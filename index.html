                    <h3>🏝️ Survival at Its Core</h3>
                    <p>Rust is a multiplayer survival game where you start with nothing but a rock and a torch. Your goal? Survive the harsh environment, wild animals, and most importantly - other players who want to take everything you've built.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>🔨 Build & Craft</h3>
                    <p>Gather resources, craft weapons, and build massive bases to protect your loot. From wooden shacks to fortified metal compounds, your creativity is your defense.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>⚔️ Raid or Be Raided</h3>
                    <p>The most intense part of Rust - raiding other players' bases to steal their hard-earned loot. Use explosives, guns, and strategy to break into enemy compounds. But watch out, because they're planning to raid YOU too.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>🎯 No Rules, No Mercy</h3>
                    <p>Rust is known for its toxic, chaotic gameplay. Form alliances, betray friends, talk trash, and dominate the server. It's not just a game - it's psychological warfare with guns.</p>

                    <h3>The Legend of RedGamer</h3>
                    <p>RedGamer isn't just a player - he's a force of nature in the Rust universe. Known for his absolutely UNHINGED raiding strategies and non-stop brainrot commentary, RedGamer has become a legend on every server he touches.</p>
                    
                    <h4>RedGamer's Playstyle: Steal Everything Brainrot Mode 🧠💀</h4>
                    <ul class="playstyle-list">
                        <li><strong>The 3AM Raid Special:</strong> When normal players sleep, RedGamer strikes. Your base? Gone. Your loot? His now. Your sanity? Destroyed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Door Camp Master:</strong> RedGamer will sit outside your base for HOURS just to get that sweet revenge kill. It's not about the loot anymore - it's about sending a message.</li>
                        <li><strong>Brainrot Tactics:</strong> Screaming into proximity chat, blasting memes through voice chat, and psychological warfare that would make military generals weep. He doesn't just steal your loot - he steals your will to play.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Naked Run:</strong> Sometimes RedGamer doesn't even need gear. He'll spawn on the beach with nothing and somehow end up with an AK and your entire inventory 10 minutes later.</li>
                        <li><strong>Trash Talk Legend:</strong> His post-raid messages are so toxic they should come with a hazmat suit. "GG EZ" is his love language.</li>
                        <li><strong>Zero Chill Philosophy:</strong> If it exists on the server, RedGamer will find it, raid it, and take everything down to the last wood plank. No base is safe. No loot is sacred.</li>
                    </ul>
